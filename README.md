# IEEELinkGrabber

Input : Take as input a query string, the topic on which IEEE links are to be obtained

Output : All the links on Page 1 of the IEEEXPLORE website returned as results for the input

Next steps : 
   
    1) Modify the program to grab Titles of papers as well along with said URLs. 
    
    2) Increase Pagination
    
    3) Make a GUI using Tkinter or Kivy.
    
    4) Make a generic version of the code to make it applicable in sites other than IEEE

What I can't help you with : IEEE access to the papers themselves :( Most of them are paid. 

What I can help you with however : If you wanted to search for articles and mail the URLS to someone who DID have access, this is the (WIP) tool for you.
